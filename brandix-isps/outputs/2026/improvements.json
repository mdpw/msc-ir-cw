      "raw_response": "NEW ACTIONS (2-3 Specific Action Items):\n1. Establish a dedicated Blockchain Implementation Team: Form a cross-functional team consisting of members from R&D, IT, Supply Chain Management, and Procurement to oversee the development and integration of blockchain technology for traceability within Brandix's operations by Q2 2024.\n   \n2. Pilot Blockchain Project: Initiate a small-scale pilot project in one supply chain segment that uses Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric to create an immutable ledger of all transactions, ensuring full end-to-end traceability from raw materials sourcing through manufacturing and delivery by Q4 2025.\n   \n3. Partner with Blockchain Solution Providers: Engage specialized blockchain technology providers that have experience in fashion supply chain applications to assist Brandix's setup of a comprehensive, sustainable traceability system tailored for the apparel industry by Q1 2024.\n   \nKPI ENHANCEMENTS (2-3 Measurable KPIs):\n1. Blockchain Integration Progress: Achieve an incremental increase in blockchain integration into supply chain processes, with a target of integrating at least one traceability project per quarter by 2027 to ensure continuous improvement and adoption across all segments.\n   \n2. System Visibility Metrics: Reach full system visibility within the pilot segment first but scale up for company-wide implementation aiming for complete end-to-end blockchain traceability with real-time updates accessible by Q3 2029, meeting or exceeding our set target of 95% visibility.\n   \n3. Employee Proficiency in Blockchain: Conduct comprehensive training programs to achieve a minimum threshold where at least 80% of the supply chain and manufacturing staff are proficient with blockchain technology by Q2 2026, ensuring an informed workforce that can maintain system efficiency post-implementation.\n   \nTIMELINE RECOMMENDATIONS (Quarterly Milestones for Year 1):\nQ1: Form the Blockchain Implementation Team and engage with blockchain solution providers. Begin staff training programs on basic blockchain concepts in supply chain management. Launch a market analysis to identify potential pilot projects that can benefit most from traceability through blockchain technology. Set up initial meetings between Brandix's teams and selected vendors/partners for project planning purposes.\n   \nQ2: Finalize the vendor partner(s), initiate detailed requirements gathering, complete an impact assessment study to understand potential ROI, risks, benefits of blockchain adoption in different segments, with quarterly updates on progress shared among stakeholders and documentation finalized for implementation. Begin creating a roadmap for pilot project rollout based on the gathered data by Q3 2024 end date.\n   \nQ3: Start small-scale pilots within selected supply chain processes to test blockchain integration, with quarterly reviews to assess performance against KPIs and tweaks as necessary. Begin drafting standard operating procedures (SOP) for full company rollout based on pilot learnings by the end of Q4 2025.\n   \nQ4: Analyze pilot project data; develop a comprehensive roadmap that includes timelines, resource allocation, and integration into larger supply chain segments across Brandix's operations with clear quarterly objectives leading to full implementation readiness for company-wide rollout by Q1 2026.\n   \nRESOURCE REQUIREMENTS (Budget, Team, Infrastructure):",
