The success will be measured quarterly by analyzing time tracking logs against predetermined value-adding activities benchmarks established from historical data analysis for Brandix's flagship products, with an aspiration of achieving a $3 million annual savings target post full implementation in Q1 2025.\n   \n2. Track the percentage reduction in lead time and logistics expenses monthly starting January 2024 to ensure that our local supplier partnerships contribute directly toward cost per unit goals, with an initial ambitious but achievable target of a 7% cumulative reduction at end-Q1 2025. This KPI will be measured against existing baselines and compared quarterly after the establishment of new supply chain agreements by Q3 2024 to adjust strategies if necessary for continual improvement towards the final objective within one year post initiation in January 2024.\n   \n3. Monitor operational efficiency improvements via output per hour, energy consumption levels (in kWh), and defect rates monthly starting with pilot automation programs roll-out by Q1 2025 to measure a consistent improvement trajectory of at least 2% towards the overall goal within one year post full implementation. These KPIs will be benchmarked against previous performance data, aiming for an average quarterly efficiency increase of about 4%, aligning with sustainability and innovation objectives by minimizing energy usage in production processes while maintaining quality standards according to Six Sigma protocols established earlier this year.\n   \nTimeframe Recommendations:\n- Implement lean manufacturing techniques across all lines within the first six months of 2024, with monthly internal audits and employee feedback sessions for continual optimization opportunities until full integration by Q1 2025.\n   \n- Develop local supplier partnerships to be in place at least a year before expected completion targets; therefore, initiate discussions immediately after KPI enhancements are identified as baselines starting January 2024 for progressive implementation with monthly checkpoints and adjustments based on performance data",
