Implement a Blockchain-based Supply Chain Management (BCSM) system to record all transactions from the sourcing of raw materials through manufacturing processes, ensuring each step is transparent and verifiable on blockchain ledgers by Q3 2025. This will directly address our objective for traceability within three years while promoting sustainable practices as any identified issues in supply chain ethics can be resolved swiftly due to this enhanced visibility.\n   \n2. Launch a Blockchain Supplier Education Program (BSEP) by Q4 2025, targeting all suppliers directly involved with Brandix and partner firms that provide raw materials for manufacturing apparel. This program will educate them on the benefits of blockchain technology in achieving supply chain traceability goals while fostering a collaborative environment focused on shared sustainability objectives.\n   \n3. Develop Blockchain Traceable Certificates (BTCs) by Q2 2026, which every batch of raw materials and final products will receive upon completion of the respective stages in production to confirm their origins and ethical sourcing methods directly correlating with sustainability efforts within our supply chain.\n   \nKPI ENHANCEMENTS:\n1. Achieve a 25% increase in blockchain-verified transactions by Q4 2026, setting the pace towards full implementation of BCSM systems and providing tangible early successes that can be built upon yearly moving forward to reach our goal of 95%.\n   \n2. Reduce supply chain discrepancies due to lack of traceability by at least 40% in Q1-Q3 each fiscal quarter, using blockchain data analytics tools for real-time monitoring and corrective actions that align with sustainable practices within our operations as we move towards full adoption.\n   \n3. Maintain a supplier compliance rate of at least 90% regarding the BSEP by Q2 each year, ensuring continuous improvement in blockchain literacy amongst partners and integration into Brandix\u2019s sustainability-focused supply chain strategy as we approach our goal for full traceability.\n   \nTIMELINE RECOMMENDATIONS: \nYear 1 Quarterly Milestones:\nQ1 - Conduct a comprehensive audit of current suppliers and raw material sourcing to establish baseline data points that will be tracked on the blockchain platform, with progress assessments every month.\n   \nQ2 - Initiate BSEP development alongside recruiting tech partnerships specialized in integrating Blockchain technology into supply chain applications by Q3 2025 to accelerate our journey towards a fully traceable network of operations and suppliers, with progress assessments every two months.\n   \nQ3 - Begin the implementation phase for BCSM systems pilot-testing within select production lines as an operational testbed while simultaneously developing Blockchain Traceable Certificates (BTCs) to be rolled out by Q4 2025 in alignment with our annual progress review and reassessment of objectives.\n   \nQ4 - Evaluate the pilot\u2019s success, feedback from suppliers engaged through BSEP, refine strategies as necessary for full-scale implementation planned to commence at the start Q1 2026 alongside expanding Blockchain Traceable Certificates (BTCs) deployment. Assess progress against KPI enhancements bi-monthly with a comprehensive review before end of fiscal year, setting up roadmaps and goals for Year 2 based on learnings from the first full cycle implementation rollout in",
