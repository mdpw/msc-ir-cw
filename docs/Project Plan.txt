Your Next Steps - Execution Plan
PHASE 1: Literature Review & Development Setup (Days 1-4)
Priority: Foundation for everything else

Literature Review (2 days)

LLMs & RAG systems
Vector databases (FAISS, Chroma)
Ontologies for business alignment
Document similarity & semantic matching
Focus: How these apply to strategic plan synchronization


Development Environment (2 days)

Install Ollama + Llama 3.1 locally (for privacy/security)
Set up Python environment (LangChain, vector DB libraries)
Test basic RAG pipeline with sample documents
Rationale: Local LLM = strong security story for your report



PHASE 2: Core System Development (Days 5-12)
Priority: Build the ISPS system

Document Processing & RAG Pipeline (3 days)

Parse your Strategic & Action Plans
Create embeddings and vector database
Implement semantic search functionality
Test retrieval quality


Synchronization Analysis Engine (3 days)

Overall alignment: Calculate document-level similarity
Strategy-wise mapping: Link each strategic objective to relevant actions
Gap detection: Identify weak/missing alignments
Use cosine similarity + LLM reasoning


Intelligent Improvement Module (2 days)

Build RAG-based suggestion system
Prompt engineering for actionable recommendations
Test with poorly aligned sections



PHASE 3: Innovation & Dashboard (Days 13-17)
Priority: Stand out features

Innovative Features (2 days)

Choose 2-3: Ontology mapping, knowledge graph, agentic reasoning
My recommendation: Knowledge graph visualization + Agentic improvement suggestions
These will score well on innovation criteria


Dashboard Development (3 days)

Use Streamlit (fastest deployment)
Synchronization metrics & visualizations
Interactive query interface
Recommendation display



PHASE 4: Testing, Deployment & Documentation (Days 18-21)
Priority: Polish and deliver

Testing & Evaluation (2 days)

Define accuracy metrics (precision/recall for mappings)
Expert validation approach
Document test results


Deployment & Security (1 day)

Host on Streamlit Cloud/HuggingFace
Document security architecture (local LLM = data privacy)
Provide live link


Final Report & Presentation (2 days)

Write comprehensive PDF report (~5,000-6,000 words)
Create presentation slides
Practice 10-minute demo




Critical Success Tips
✅ Use your industry knowledge: Your Brandix experience = authentic examples for report
✅ Local LLM = security win: Emphasize data privacy in architecture section
✅ Focus on synchronization gaps: Show where Action Plan misses Strategic objectives
✅ Visual appeal matters: Good dashboard UI = 10 marks
✅ Live demo ready: Test end-to-end before submission
Time Management

4 hours/day × 21 days = 84 hours total
Built-in buffer for debugging/issues
December 20th deadline with 10 days to spare
